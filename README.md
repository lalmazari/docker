# Docker Basics

## What is Docker?

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers allow developers to package an application and its dependencies together in a standardized environment, ensuring consistency across different environments.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Containers

A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. Containers isolate the application from the underlying system, making it portable and consistent.

### 2. Images

An image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. Images are the building blocks of containers and can be shared and reused.

### 3. Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It defines the base image, adds necessary dependencies, and configures the environment. Dockerfiles are used to automate the image creation process.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Download and install Docker from the official website: [Get Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

### 2. Hello World

Create a simple Docker container running a "Hello World" application:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest
CMD ["echo", "Hello World"]
Build the image:

docker build -t hello-world .
Run the container:

docker run hello-world
3. Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Create a docker-compose.yml file to define a multi-container application:

yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  app:
    image: your-app-image:latest
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
Run the application with Docker Compose:


docker-compose up

Advanced Topics
1. Volumes
Volumes allow data to persist between container runs. They are used to share data between the host machine and containers.

2. Networking
Docker Networking enables communication between containers and with external networks. Containers can be connected to custom networks for isolation and better control over communication.

3. Docker Hub
Docker Hub is a repository of Docker images. You can find and share pre-built images, making it easy to use existing solutions.

Conclusion
Docker simplifies the process of developing, shipping, and running applications, providing a consistent and portable environment across different systems.
